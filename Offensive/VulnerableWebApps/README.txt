This is a summary of Webgoat, Juice Shop, DVWA, and the PortSwigger Academy

Key Takeaways
  WebGoat was the first offensive-oriented project I've worked on, and it provided a great introduction to the OWASP Top 10. It guides you through the concepts and serves as a perfect starting point. It took me 20 hours to complete it.
  Juice Shop was done right after. It is a lot more CTF-style and can be very complicated. You complete over a hundred tasks through the scoreboard, focusing on various vulnerabilities, including and beyond the OWASP Top 10, and it is entirely up to you to find the solution. The first few challenges have walkthroughs, but after that, you are entirely expected to know what to do, or at least what to research. Some of the challenges also have coding challenges associated with them, where you receive a code snippet and must identify the incorrect lines, then select the correct implementation. I would recommend doing this after the PortSwigger Academy. It took me 40 hours to complete.
  DVWA is similar to WebGoat. It has 4 difficulties for every topic, ranging from no security to impossible, which is intended to have no solution. It has several unique aspects, including topics that I have not encountered in any other learning environment, such as Insecure CAPTCHA and Insecure Session ID creation. It also shows you the code implementation for each difficulty, which can help teach secure coding practices. I recommend doing this after WebGoat. It took me 25 hours to complete.
  PortSwigger Academy is a requirement for learning web pentesting. It teaches you how to use Burp Suite, which is a tool that manipulates traffic to the web server. These types of tools are a necessity for web pentesting. It also contains, by far, the most unique topics and delves the most in-depth into them. There are 3 different areas of the academy. The most guided part was the learning paths, which included one-third of the labs, and took me 30 hours. The topic section would be another option, but the overlap is significant with the learning paths, so you would have to be very selective. I opted to skip this part and just complete the remaining labs. I am still working on this in conjunction with Hack The Box, and I expect it to take approximately 40 hours to complete. You can skip WebGoat and DVWA and do this instead, but I think following the path of WebGoat, then DVWA, and then this academy is the best approach. The overlap isn't a waste of time; rather, it helps you identify vulnerabilities in different forms.
